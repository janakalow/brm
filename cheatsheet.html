<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Business Research: A Cheat Sheet</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style3">By Dr. Janaka Low</p>


<h1>1.0&nbsp; INTRODUCTION </h1>
This “cheat sheet” is compiled based on (i) my experience as a 
panel member in many master and doctoral viva sessions, and (ii) my interactions 
with students who are doing or have completed research at master and doctorate 
level.<p>This guide is applicable to both master and doctoral students. Please 
bear in mind that there are significant differences between master and doctoral 
research. In addition to higher expectation on rigor in design and analysis, 
doctoral research requires significant theoretical contributions to the field of 
study. </p>
<p>In the following section, I will go through a typical research report 
structure. To make the cheat sheet more useful, I have included (i) frequently 
asked questions (FAQ) you will face during viva sessions, and (ii) a checklist 
at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p>In the last section, I will give general advice on managing the research 
project. These pieces of advice are quite important. Most students who fail to 
complete their research was due to the problems mention in this section. Note 
that this guide is biased toward quantitative methods due to my limited 
experience in qualitative and mixed-mode research. Also, the guide mainly deals 
with academic research rather than the industry research. </p>
<h1>2.0&nbsp; CHAPTER STRUCTURE</h1>
<p>Most higher learning institutions require the students to structure their 
thesis/report into a 5-6 chapter write up. Typically, 5-chapter structure will 
include (1) Introduction, (2) Literature review, (3) Methodology, (4) Analysis 
and results, (5) Discussion and Conclusion. 6-chapter structure usually has a 
dedicated chapter on the research theoretical framework after literature review, 
resulting in (1) Introduction, (2) Literature review, (3) Theoretical framework, 
(4) Methodology, (5) Analysis and Results, (6) Discussion and Conclusion. In 
Europe, it is common to see literature review and analysis expend to multiple 
chapters. </p>
<p>Do not start or end your chapter abruptly. Each chapter should start with an 
introductory paragraph. Usually it will mention what the chapter is about. Each 
chapter should end with a concluding paragraph. Usually it summarizes what you 
said in the chapter. Similarly do this for every major section in your thesis or 
report. For sections that are closely linked with the subsequent sections, write 
a leading sentence to prepare or lead your reader for the following sections.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe what you should (and should not) write in 
each chapter. </p>
<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction </h1>
<p>The introduction chapter should include the background of the issue or 
problem in which your research is conducted. In this chapter, you will need to 
state your research gap clearly. </p>
<p>Gaps are “holes” in the knowledge, which you are trying to patch. We find 
gaps when an issue is not addressed in the literature (perhaps due to new 
development in the business environment such as the advancement of social 
media), or when there is inconsistency between a number of studies, or when 
there is an unresolved issue in the literature. </p>
<p>Gaps are usually expressed in the research problem statement. It can be a 
national problem (e.g.., competitiveness of a country), a company problem 
(e.g.., your company is facing sales problem), an industry problem (e.g.., the 
hospitality industry is facing a problem), a business function problem (e.g.., 
the operation of your company is inefficient), a theoretical problem (e.g.., a 
theory proposed by the previous research is not generalizable), or a methodology 
problem (e.g.., a research method used in a previous research was 
inappropriate). Problem statement should include: (i) what you know, (ii) what 
you don’t know, and (iii) what you want to know. </p>
<p>After explaining the background situation, you bring out the need to perform 
further research in a specific area. This will be your <em>research objectives</em>.
</p>
<p>Once you have the research objectives, you list down all your questions that 
your research will attempt to answer. This will be your research questions. </p>
<p>Following this, you should emphasize the <em>possible</em> significance of 
your research. Your research significance should answer these few questions: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Will your research contribute to any theoretical understanding about the 
	field? If yes, how? This will be your theoretical implications. </li>
	<li>Will your research bring about practical or managerial implications? If 
	yes, how? This will be your managerial implication. </li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to be explicit in your unit of analysis. If you are analyzing 
companies, your unit of analysis will be at the company level. If you are 
researching individual employee or consumer, then your unit of analysis will be 
at the individual level. </p>
<p>Be very careful about your ability to collect enough data from companies. </p>
<h2><strong>Check list for Introduction </strong></h2>
<ul class="auto-style1">
	<li>&nbsp;Provided business or industry problems that justify the need for 
this study. </li>
	<li>Research problem is defined clearly. Research problem is phrased 
in terms of gaps in theories or understanding. </li>
	<li>Research objectives are defined clearly. Be sure that the research 
objective is not to solve the business problem per se, but to provide 
understanding of the business situation. </li>
	<li>Research objectives are aligned with research problem. </li>
	<li>Included potential contribution to academia, industry, etc. 
Explained why this research is different from other research studies. Use 
contextual factors if appropriate (e.g., cultural differences). </li>
	<li>Included chapter organization for the rest of the thesis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Viva FAQ </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>What will be your contribution of your research? </li>
	<li>&nbsp;What is your unit of analysis?<br>This is commonly asked if you 
	have not explicitly specified your unit of analysis. Unit of analysis 
	indicates what or who should provide the data and at what level of 
	aggregation. See Zikmund et. Al, 8th Ed p. 119; Sekaran &amp; Bougie 5th Ed p. 
	116. Also note that it is possible to have multiple levels of analysis in a 
	single project – but this is not common at master level. </li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;Chapter 2: Literature Review </h1>
<p>Start your literature review on the broadest concept. Then gradually narrow 
down to specific concept. </p>
<p>For example, if you are researching about marketing control, start with the 
review of the broad concept of “control” and “marketing”. Then explain how other 
authors gradually focus on the issue of marketing control. </p>
<p>Another example, let’s say you are using observational learning theory to 
frame your research, you should start with introduction to learning theories, 
then down to external learning approach, then down to environment-driven 
learning, then only you go to observational learning theory. See figure below.

<p><img alt="Hierarchy of theories" height="285" src="theories.png" width="400"></p>
<h2><strong>Underlying Theory </strong></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In many universities, you are required 
to use “underlying” or “underpinning”, or “parent” theories to support your 
hypotheses or framework. This requirement has been a major trauma for many 
students whom I have worked with. This is simply because in the academic world, 
everything has to be supported by “theories”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>Most of the management and business concepts have their roots on basic 
philosophical theories. As business and management are closely related to 
economic theories, many theories have their root in economics. </p>
<p>The &quot;Encyclopedia of Management Theory&quot; (http://goo.gl/qU2Nn2) gives us a 
list of management theories. Alternatively, you can get the eBook from Google 
Play Book Store (see http://goo.gl/35eo51) and read it on your smart devices.
</p>
<p>Theories can also be called “model”, “principle”, or sometimes just the name 
itself, e.g., “hierarchy of needs”. </p>
<p>Accounting researcher may benefit from accounting theories<span lang="en-my">

<p>&nbsp;Organization theories can be used for management and HR research<span lang="en-my"> 
(</span>See
<a href="http://www.academy-british.co.uk/Library-eng/organizational-theory.pdf">
http://www.academy-british.co.uk/Library-eng/organizational-theory.pdf</a>, p. 
12.<span lang="en-my">)</span> </p>
<h2><strong>Citing previous studies</strong> </h2>
<p>You can use a variety of expression to accurately describe the authors’ 
positions. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>According to the findings of Kotler and Keller (2012), … </li>
	<li>Kotler and Keller (2012) pointed out argued that … </li>
	<li>The X was found to be related to Y (Kotler &amp; Keller, 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid vague and weak expression such as “Kotler <em>stated</em> that…”, or 
“Kotler <em>mentioned</em> that …”. A better choice of verb includes the 
following: <em>assert</em>, <em>emphasize</em>, <em>posit</em>, <em>argue</em>,
<em>maintain</em>, <em>suggest</em>, <em>propose</em>, <em>point out</em>, <em>
claim</em> and <em>consider</em>. You can also use these verbs to indicate that 
an author has made certain findings: <em>confirm</em>, <em>report</em>, <em>
conclude</em>, <em>identify</em>, <em>found</em>, <em>reveal</em>, <em>
demonstrate</em>, and <em>discover</em>. </p>
<p>For the field of business and management, ideally you should have 40% of your 
literature taken from recent publications, i.e., within the past 5 years. </p>
<h2><strong>Theoretical Framework </strong></h2>
<p>Based on what you want to do (research objectives) and literature reviews, 
you should have decided what you want to prove. </p>
<p>Usually you want to show that different concepts are related (correlated with 
each other, one variable causes another, some are grouped together) and you can 
draw your theoretical framework. </p>
<p>All key <em>concepts</em> in your research must be measurable. When a concept 
is measured on a scale, it is referred to as <em>variable</em>. When a concept 
is measured with several scale items, it is referred to as a <em>construct</em>.
</p>
<h2><strong>Writing Hypotheses</strong> </h2>
<p>Hypotheses should be phrased clearly and it must be testable. There are at 
least three 3 ways to express your hypotheses: </p>
<ol>
	<li>If-then statements: e.g., (i) “Younger employees will be more 
	productive.” (ii) “If the employee is younger, they will be more 
	productive.” </li>
	<li>Directional statements: e.g., “The greater the stress level, the lower 
	the job satisfaction of employees.” </li>
	<li>Non-directional statements: e.g., (i) “There is a relationship between 
	the age and job satisfaction level.” (ii) There is a difference between the 
	productivity of men and women. </li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever way you choose, you should be consistent throughout your entire 
write up. </p>
<p>The most common forms of the theoretical framework diagrams have the 
independent variables (IV) on the left and dependent variables (DV) on the 
right. </p>
<p><img alt="IV-Dv" height="158" src="iv-dv.png" width="400"></p>
<p>Note that this is a very simplistic framework. You may have moderating 
variable (MV) in between: </p>
<p><img alt="Moderating variable" height="217" src="mv.png" width="400"></p>
<p>It is important to understand that moderating variables weaken, amplify or 
even reverse effects of IV on DV. MV does not directly affect DV. For example, 
we suspect that psychotherapy may reduce depression – more for men than for 
women; we would say that gender (MV) moderates the relationship between 
psychotherapy (IV) and depression (DV). </p>
<p>In some cases, you may have intervening<span lang="en-my"> </span>(IVV) 
variables: Intervening variable<span lang="en-my">s</span> <span lang="en-my">
are</span> also known as mediating variable<span lang="en-my">s</span>.</p>
<p><img alt="Intervening variable" height="155" src="ivv.png" width="400"></p>
<p>Also, you should specify all your hypotheses in this chapter. </p>
<h2><strong>Check list for literature review </strong></h2>
<ul class="auto-style1">
	<li>Chapter introduction <span lang="en-my">section </span>includes the 
	scope of literature you are reviewing. </li>

	</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Viva FAQ </strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>What is your underlying theory? </li>
	<li>&nbsp;What is your research design? The answer to this question is 
	usually “correlational design” or “causal design”<span lang="en-my">. </span>
	See Sekaran &amp; Bouie 5th Ed p. 110. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Chapter 3: Research Methodology </h1>
<p>In this chapter, you should discuss about your methodologies. </p>
<p>Here you can also review literature, but only on their methodologies. You can 
borrow survey questions from other authors which are established in their 
fields. </p>
<h2><strong>Check list for Research Methodology </strong></h2>
<ul class="auto-style1">
	<li>Stated if the approach is quantitative or qualitative, with 
	justification. </li>
	<li>Sampling approach (random/non-random, sample size, population) is 
	discussed and justified. </li>
	<li>If questionnaire is used, indicate if the questions are adopted or 
	adapted. Justify your choice with literature.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;If questionnaire is used, a complete set of questionnaires is 
	included in the appendix. </li>
	<li>All variables are measured in the questionnaire. If Likert scale is 
	used, there is no “intensity” words (very, always, never, etc.). E.g., ask 
	“The employees are satisfied with their works” Instead of “The employees are 
	very satisfied with their works.” </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Viva FAQ </strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>1.&nbsp; How do you ensure the validity of your data?<ul>
		<li>Generally you will want to quote definitions and questions used by 
		previous authors to establish face validity and content validity. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>2.How do you ensure the reliability of your data?<ul>
		<li>Generally, there are two ways: use the Cronbach alpha statistic, or 
		test and retest method. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chapter 4: Analysis and Results </h1>
<p>In this chapter, you present the overview of the data collected. Indicate if 
your data collection efforts is successful. You should also present a table 
showing the profile of the respondents. </p>
<p>Then you can show a descriptive statistics table with at least mean and 
standard deviation values for each variable you measured. </p>
<p>A correlation matrix is a useful way to show whether there are correlations 
between your variables. So include it. </p>
<p>You should at least perform reliability tests to the data. Typically, this is 
done with Cronbach alpha analysis. Drop the items that contribute to low 
reliability statistic. </p>

explanations of the results, discuss the theoretical and managerial 
implications, and mention about the limitations of the research. You should also 
include suggestion for future research, usually based on the limitation of the 
research, or new ideas that you have that do not fit into the current research.

<h1>Writing Abstract </h1>
<p>Abstract can be overlooked easily by many students and it is often written 
haphazardly without much thought. A good abstract should include the following 
elements: (i) Purpose, (ii) Design / methodology / approach, (iii) Findings, 
(iv) Research limitations / implications, and (v) originality/value of the 
research. For example, here is an appropriate abstract<span lang="en-my">:</span></p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;The primary purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the 
	significant determinant for supply chain partnering (SCP) that can be 
	applied by the firms to increase their effectiveness in SCP efforts. Next, 
	the paper intends to examine the impact of scalable partnering towards the 
	effectiveness of SCP. To address the research problem, a survey instrument 
	is developed and a structured model is hypothesized and tested using SPSS 
	tool. Data are collected from a field research on a sample of 584 companies 
	in Malaysia. The result of this research indicates that resource sharing has 
	positive influences on SCP. Increasing scalable partnering would also lead 
	to increases in the effectiveness of SCP. One of the limitations of the 
	study is that the use of a single key informant for the data collection from 
	the respective companies. A more stringent test of the relationships between 
	scalable partnering and its impact in SCP requires a longitudinal study. 
	Managers must also recognize the influential role of scalable partnering 
	which motivates channel partners to continue their investment in SCM 
	initiatives. Thus, managers should pay more attention to the need of channel 
	member to generate a higher level of confidence in scalable partnering. 
	While SCP and its determinant exist in prior research, this paper 
	contributes a new variable “Scalable Partnering” towards strengthening the 
	relationship among the supply chain partners.
</blockquote>
<p>Dissecting the abstract, we see the 5 elements: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Purpose</strong> – The primary purpose of this paper is to 
	examine empirically the significant determinant for supply chain partnering 
	(SCP) that can be applied by the firms to increase their effectiveness in 
	SCP efforts. Next, the paper intends to examine the impact of scalable 
	partnering towards the effectiveness of SCP. </li>
	<li><strong>Design/methodology/approach</strong> – To address the research 
	problem, a survey instrument is developed and a structured model is 
	hypothesized and tested using SPSS tool. Data are collected from a field 
	research on a sample of 584 companies in Malaysia. </li>
	<li><strong>Findings</strong> – The result of this research indicates that 
	resource sharing have positive influences on SCP. Increasing scalable 
	partnering would also lead to increases in the effectiveness of SCP. </li>
	<li><strong>Research limitations/implications</strong> – One of the 
	limitations of the study is that the use of a single key informant for the 
	data collection from the respective companies. A more stringent test of the 
	relationships between scalable partnering and its impact in SCP requires a 
	longitudinal study. </li>
	<li><strong>Practical implications</strong> – Managers must also recognize 
	the influential role of scalable partnering which motivates channel partners 
	to continue their investment in SCM initiatives. Thus, managers should pay 
	more attention to the need of channel member to generate a higher level of 
	confidence in scalable partnering. Originality/value – While SCP and its 
	determinant exist in prior research, this paper contributes a new variable 
	“Scalable Partnering” towards strengthening the relationship among the 
	supply chain partners </li>
</ul>
<h1>3.0&nbsp; MANAGING THE PROJECT </h1>
<p>Like any other projects, your research must be carefully planned and put in 
the necessary commitments and resources. </p>
<p>Here are some tips: </p>
<h2><strong>Choose Your Topic Carefully </strong></h2>
<p>Generally, there are 3 considerations: (a) choose an area that you are 
familiar with; (b) you must be able to collect data; (c) you have passion in the 
chosen area. </p>
<p>Being familiar with a topic is very important especially when you are 
defending your proposal or findings. You will face both broad and in-depth 
questions during your defense session. Your examiners can quickly form a 
negative opinion about you if your answers as superficial. </p>
<p>Ability to collect data is crucial. Without data, you will not be able to 
proceed with your research beyond proposal. </p>
<p>Your passion in the chosen research area is important because you need the 
drive and motivation to complete the often long and arduous research journey. In 
addition, the examiners will feel positive about you if you speak passionately 
about your research during your defense. Generally, examiners despise candidates 
who don’t take interest in his or her research topic. </p>
<h2>Commit Your Time </h2>
<p>The biggest and most frequent mistake students make is underestimating the 
time required to conduct and complete the research. </p>
<p>The very fact that it is a <strong><span lang="en-my">&quot;</span>re<span lang="en-my">&quot;</span></strong>search 
implies that you will need several rounds of trials and errors. As much as we 
would like it to be structured, its nature is unstructured, ambiguous, 
unpredictable and full of surprises. As such, you should give yourself plenty of 
buffer time. Unless you are a seasoned researcher, the small mistakes you make 
along the way can throw you off track. </p>
<p>If you are part-time students, prepare to take some leaves from your work 
during the initial period of your research. Give yourself enough time to immerse 
yourself in the research topic. </p>
<p>Imagine if you need 30 minutes to boil a kettle of water, 10 minutes of 
boiling distributed over 3 days won’t do it. You must boil it in one go. </p>
<h2>Know the Expectations </h2>
<p>Working on research means working at the edge of human knowledge. In that 
place, you do not find a lot of agreements among the people living there. Not 
only experts disagree with the concepts and theories, they also have strong 
disagreement in styles and approaches. One university can place high importance 
on quantitative method while another university has distaste on number 
crunching. In other words, there are different “research culture” in different 
research institutions. Be mindful of the acceptable boundary of your 
“stakeholders” – your supervisor, your university and your potential examiners. 
Crossing the boundary means hell for you. </p>
<h2>Get Yourself up to Speed Quickly </h2>
<p>There are two reasons for this. First, you want to be able to get familiar 
with the concepts used in the field so that you can understand the literature 
and discuss with your supervisor intelligently. Secondly, you want to avoid 
making conceptual mistakes. A term used commonly in daily conversation can have 
very different meaning in research. In research, you should avoid using terms in 
a very general sense, especially the concepts related to the key variables in 
your research. For example, the term “impact” is used in our daily language, but 
need to be defined very specifically in your research. </p>
<p>There are two ways to get you up to speed quickly: talk to people and read 
others’ works. </p>
<p>Talking to people does not mean talking to anyone. There are specific 
techniques you can use. Start with purposeful <em>interview</em> with the 
leading experts in the field, and conduct <em>focus groups</em> if your research 
involves practical issues. Since most business research projects are not basic 
research projects, you can almost be certain that you will benefit from a focus 
group. </p>
<p>Reading others’ work is not as obvious as you think. You may be tempted to 
start reading the world leading journal in the field. However, you will miss a 
lot of points for skipping the past research done at your very own university. 
Remember that the research papers done locally are the ones that fulfill the 
acceptable boundaries. Reading them get you to have realistic plan early. </p>
<h2>Be Unambitious </h2>
<p>Unless this is your 10th research project, your main objective in the project 
should be just learning the research methods and acquiring the research skills.
</p>
<p>Too often novice researchers are expecting their first research to solve 
their real world problems. While it is true that your interest in solving 
certain problem leads you to taking up the master or doctoral degree, do not 
expect your research to solve your real problem. If it eventually does solve the 
problem, cool, otherwise, it is perfectly okay. Remember your research project 
has enough burdens to meet many requirements – especially those set by your 
institution. Do not impose further requirements on it, or you risk killing it. 
Tell yourself it is not going to be the last research you do in your life. Leave 
it for another day. </p>
<h2>Set up Rhythm </h2>
<p>Research should be done by matured individuals. That is why research is only 
done by master and doctorate level students. </p>
<p>Most supervisors expect you to take the driver seat. That means you are 
expected to plan and manage your entire research. No babysitting, no spoon 
feeding. </p>
<p>Matured students take initiatives and take ownership of the research efforts. 
Some compassionate supervisors will try their best to help you. Even so, they 
can quickly get dishearten if you are not interested to help yourself. </p>
<p>The easiest way to help yourself is to quickly set up the rhythm of your 
meeting with the supervisor. Once the project has started, make a point to meet 
your supervisor regularly. Fortnightly or monthly is appropriate. If you do not 
contact your supervisor several months in a row, you risk your supervisor losing 
interest in helping you. </p>
<p>Regularly meeting your supervisor also gives yourself extra push to complete 
the work. Use the meeting as mini-checkpoints, which force you to show your 
supervisor some progress. </p>
<p>I use the term “rhythm” intentionally. Think of it as your heart beat. If you 
fail to set up the rhythm, your research will be dead soon. </p>
<h2>Talk it Over, Face-to-Face </h2>
<p>You may be tech-savvy. But you cannot change the human behavior. It is 
tempting for part-time students to rely on emails to communicate with their 
supervisors. That can be a big mistake! I have seen many students failed or 
nearly failed because of their refusal to meet face-to-face. </p>
<p>When you meet your supervisor, a lot more things are going on than just 
exchange of information and facts. There are body language and other non-verbal 
communications going on. More importantly, your supervisor may need to get 
across many emotional messages that cannot be embedded in words inside emails. 
It is not because your supervisor is unable to express them in typed words. He 
or she simply does not want to communicate it through formal “black and white” 
channel. Strong emotions, such as being pleased with your progress or frustrated 
with your failures, will never be written in emails. Just imagine, who is 
willing to have a conversation with you if he or she knows that you have turned 
on a voice recorder? These emotional clues are extremely important messages that 
the supervisors would want you to receive. </p>
<p>The best is still having face-to-face meeting. Otherwise, try Skype or Google 
Hangout. If that still is not possible, make phone calls. Use email only as the 
last resort for discussion. Email should only be used for completed works for 
review. </p>
<h2>Managing Your Supervisor </h2>
<p>It is very important for you to have a positive and professional relationship 
with your supervisor. Here are some useful principles: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Demonstrate to your supervisor that you are serious about your research 
	and committed to it. Show that you really put in time <span lang="en-my">for</span> your research. </li>
	<li>Meet your supervisor regularly and do what you have committed to do in 
	the last meet<span lang="en-my">ing</span>. </li>
	<li>Publication is an important reward for your supervisor, therefore, put 
	in effort toward having your work published. </li>
	<li>On one hand, a supervisor can be very open and only give<span lang="en-my">s</span> you high-level 
	guidelines. You are given a lot of freedom to choose the topic and research 
	approach. On the other hand, <span lang="en-my">a </span>supervisor can be very “prescriptive” and 
	give<span lang="en-my">s</span> you very specific topic and research approach. The are pros and cons on 
	these two extreme<span lang="en-my">s</span>. Discuss with your supervisor if you need more freedom or 
	more “prescription” (when you are stuck and clueless). </li>
</ul>
<h2>Justify Everything </h2>
<p>The key to defending your research is to prepare yourself for challenges from 
your supervisor or examiners. You should proactively justify everything: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Justify your research objectives by emphasizing their contributions to 
	theories and practitioners. </li>
	<li>Justify your theoretical framework and hypotheses by reviewing 
	underlying theories, findings from other research and your research 
	objectives. If you put a variable as moderator or intervening variable, 
	specify why you think so.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Justify your methodology (sample, instruments, data collection 
	methods and analysis methods) by<ul>
		<li>citing methods of other successful research works, </li>
		<li>practicality such as your time constraints. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Justify your finding by using commonly used statistics, e.g., scale is 
	reliable if the Cronbach Alpha is acceptable. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Word Processing Skill </h2>
<p>I still see student typing out the table of contents by hand. You should 
spend some time learning the critical skills on these features: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Using headings properly so that you can generate table of contents. 
	Ideally you should have your entire report in just one Word document file.
	</li>
	<li>Use caption to label figures and tables, and cross reference from texts.
	</li>
	<li>Learn to use and custom<span lang="en-my">ize</span> styles. This will 
	give you a consistent appearance to your document. Do not format your text 
	paragraph by paragraph. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing skills matter </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Never expect your research supervisor to correct your language and 
	formatting. Most lecturers think that you don’t care about your work if you 
	do not proofread it carefully before submission. </li>
	<li>Coherence in your writing is very important. Focus on what you want to 
	research, explain why, and how you want to do it. Do not pull in unrelated 
	information that will not help to support your research. </li>
	<li>Write short and clear sentences. Long sentence tends to have convoluted 
	meaning.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Write a short introductory paragraph at the beginning of every 
	chapter or main section to tell and to prepare the reader of what to expect 
	in the chapter or section. </li>
	<li>Each paragraph should start with the key sentence that lets the readers 
	know the main point of the paragraph. Otherwise your report will be very 
	hard to read. </li>
	<li>Don’t include basic “textbook” stuffs, such as what is quantitative 
	research. Assume your readers to be knowledgeable in research method. Just 
	go ahead and write about your research. </li>
	<li>“Research” should be a singular. If you need to refer to more than one, 
	say “Two research studies show that …”. </li>
</ul>
<h2>On Plagiarism </h2>
<p>Generally, you should not exceed 2<span lang="en-my">0</span>% similarity. 
You should check with your institution the expected threshold.</p>
<h2>General Tips </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Don’t believe that you cannot learn to design and conduct research. </li>
	<li>Doing research is just like swimming, you can’t learn it solely from 
	books. You must do it to learn it. </li>
	<li>Research can be an act of hair-splitting. But it is the hair-splitting 
	that advances our knowledge. </li>
	<li>Research communities have their own jargons. Term such as “framework”, 
	“research questions” have specific meaning. The more you are familiar with 
	these terms, the less likely you will make mistakes. </li>
	<li><span lang="en-my">Join the research community. A good place to start is 
	Researchgate.com.</span></li>
</ol>
<h1>4.0&nbsp; CONCLUSION </h1>
<p>Doing a research is not simple and requires detailed planning and execution. 
You should understand the requirements and the rule of the game clearly as early 
as possible. Commit time, learn quickly, set up work rhythm and communicate 
face-to-face with your supervisor often. </p>
<p><span lang="en-my">P/S: I wish you all the best in your research. If you have 
questions or comments, please email to <a href="mailto:janaka.low@gmail.com">
