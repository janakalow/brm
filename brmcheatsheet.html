    <title>Business Research: A Cheat Sheet
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>By Dr. Janaka Low</p>


1.0&nbsp; INTRODUCTION This “cheat sheet” is compiled based on (i) my experience as a 
panel member in many master and doctoral viva sessions, and (ii) my interactions 
with students who are doing or have completed research at master and doctorate 
level.<p>This guide is applicable to both master and doctoral students. Please 
bear in mind that there are significant differences between master and doctoral 
research. In addition to higher expectation on rigor in design and analysis, 
doctoral research requires significant theoretical contributions to the field of 
study. </p>
<p>In the following section, I will go through a typical research report 
structure. To make the cheat sheet more useful, I have included (i) frequently 
asked questions (FAQ) you will face during viva sessions, and (ii) a checklist 
at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p>In the last section, I will give general advice on managing the research 
project. These pieces of advice are quite important. Most students who fail to 
complete their research was due to the problems mention in this section. Note 
that this guide is biased toward quantitative methods due to my limited 
experience in qualitative and mixed-mode research. Also, the guide mainly deals 
with academic research rather than the industry research. </p>
