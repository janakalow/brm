    <title>Business Research: A Cheat Sheet
</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>By Dr. Janaka Low</p>


1.0&nbsp; INTRODUCTION This “cheat sheet” is compiled based on (i) my experience as a 
panel member in many master and doctoral viva sessions, and (ii) my interactions 
with students who are doing or have completed research at master and doctorate 
level.<p>This guide is applicable to both master and doctoral students. Please 
bear in mind that there are significant differences between master and doctoral 
research. In addition to higher expectation on rigor in design and analysis, 
doctoral research requires significant theoretical contributions to the field of 
study. </p>
<p>In the following section, I will go through a typical research report 
structure. To make the cheat sheet more useful, I have included (i) frequently 
asked questions (FAQ) you will face during viva sessions, and (ii) a checklist 
at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p>In the last section, I will give general advice on managing the research 
project. These pieces of advice are quite important. Most students who fail to 
complete their research was due to the problems mention in this section. Note 
that this guide is biased toward quantitative methods due to my limited 
experience in qualitative and mixed-mode research. Also, the guide mainly deals 
with academic research rather than the industry research. </p>
<h1>2.0&nbsp; CHAPTER STRUCTURE</h1>
<p>Most higher learning institutions require the students to structure their 
thesis/report into a 5-6 chapter write up. Typically, 5-chapter structure will 
include (1) Introduction, (2) Literature review, (3) Methodology, (4) Analysis 
and results, (5) Discussion and Conclusion. 6-chapter structure usually has a 
dedicated chapter on the research theoretical framework after literature review, 
resulting in (1) Introduction, (2) Literature review, (3) Theoretical framework, 
(4) Methodology, (5) Analysis and Results, (6) Discussion and Conclusion. In 
Europe, it is common to see literature review and analysis expend to multiple 
chapters. </p>
<p>Do not start or end your chapter abruptly. Each chapter should start with an 
introductory paragraph. Usually it will mention what the chapter is about. Each 
chapter should end with a concluding paragraph. Usually it summarizes what you 
said in the chapter. Similarly do this for every major section in your thesis or 
report. For sections that are closely linked with the subsequent sections, write 
a leading sentence to prepare or lead your reader for the following sections.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe what you should (and should not) write in 
each chapter. </p>
<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction </h1>
<p>The introduction chapter should include the background of the issue or 
problem in which your research is conducted. In this chapter, you will need to 
state your research gap clearly. </p>
<p>Gaps are “holes” in the knowledge, which you are trying to patch. We find 
gaps when an issue is not addressed in the literature (perhaps due to new 
development in the business environment such as the advancement of social 
media), or when there is inconsistency between a number of studies, or when 
there is an unresolved issue in the literature. </p>
<p>Gaps are usually expressed in the research problem statement. It can be a 
national problem (e.g.., competitiveness of a country), a company problem 
(e.g.., your company is facing sales problem), an industry problem (e.g.., the 
hospitality industry is facing a problem), a business function problem (e.g.., 
the operation of your company is inefficient), a theoretical problem (e.g.., a 
theory proposed by the previous research is not generalizable), or a methodology 
problem (e.g.., a research method used in a previous research was 
inappropriate). Problem statement should include: (i) what you know, (ii) what 
you don’t know, and (iii) what you want to know. </p>
<p>After explaining the background situation, you bring out the need to perform 
further research in a specific area. This will be your <em>research objectives</em>.
</p>
<p>Once you have the research objectives, you list down all your questions that 
your research will attempt to answer. This will be your research questions. </p>
<p>Following this, you should emphasize the <em>possible</em> significance of 
your research. Your research significance should answer these few questions: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Will your research contribute to any theoretical understanding about the 
	field? If yes, how? This will be your theoretical implications. </li>
	<li>Will your research bring about practical or managerial implications? If 
	yes, how? This will be your managerial implication. </li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to be explicit in your unit of analysis. If you are analyzing 
companies, your unit of analysis will be at the company level. If you are 
researching individual employee or consumer, then your unit of analysis will be 
at the individual level. </p>
<p>Be very careful about your ability to collect enough data from companies. </p>
<p><strong>Check list for Introduction </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided business or industry problems that justify the need for 
this study. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research problem is defined clearly. Research problem is phrased 
in terms of gaps in theories or understanding. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research objectives are defined clearly. Be sure that the research 
objective is not to solve the business problem per se, but to provide 
understanding of the business situation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research objectives are aligned with research problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included potential contribution to academia, industry, etc. 
Explained why this research is different from other research studies. Use 
contextual factors if appropriate (e.g., cultural differences). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included chapter organization for the rest of the thesis. </p>
<p><strong>Viva FAQ </strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>What will be your contribution of your research? </li>
	<li>&nbsp;What is your unit of analysis?<br>This is commonly asked if you 
	have not explicitly specified your unit of analysis. Unit of analysis 
	indicates what or who should provide the data and at what level of 
	aggregation. See Zikmund et. Al, 8th Ed p. 119; Sekaran &amp; Bougie 5th Ed p. 
	116. Also note that it is possible to have multiple levels of analysis in a 
	single project – but this is not common at master level. </li>
</ol>
<h1>&nbsp;Chapter 2: Literature Review </h1>
<p>Start your literature review on the broadest concept. Then gradually narrow 
down to specific concept. </p>
<p>For example, if you are researching about marketing control, start with the 
review of the broad concept of “control” and “marketing”. Then explain how other 
authors gradually focus on the issue of marketing control. </p>
<p>Another example, let’s say you are using observational learning theory to 
frame your research, you should start with introduction to learning theories, 
then down to external learning approach, then down to environment-driven 
learning, then only you go to observational learning theory. See figure below.
